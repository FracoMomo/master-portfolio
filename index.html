                       My journey into <span class="highlight">Web Development</span> started 10 months ago when I discovered the power of turning ideas into interactive experiences. What began as curiosity about how websites work has evolved into a genuine passion for creating digital solutions. I'm currently focused on mastering the fundamentals of front-end development while exploring the endless possibilities of code.

                       I'm building my foundation with <span class="highlight">HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript</span>, along with version control using <span class="highlight">Git</span>. My background in basic C programming gives me a solid understanding of programming logic and problem-solving approaches. Right now, I'm diving deeper into modern JavaScript concepts and responsive design principles, with plans to explore <span class="highlight">React and Node.js</span> in the coming months.

                        Currently a 2nd year <span class="highlight">BSIT student</span>, where I'm developing strong technical fundamentals and analytical thinking skills. My coursework provides me with a solid foundation in programming concepts, object-oriented and non object-oriented programming, system design and experience, which I actively apply to my personal development projects.

                        Beyond coding, my creative background has given me valuable skills in project management, creativity, visual design, and <span class="highlight">user experience</span>. I bring strong communication skills, attention to detail, and the ability to see projects from concept to completion. My goal is <span class="highlight">to create web applications</span> that are not just functional, but genuinely helpful and engaging for users, combining technical expertise with creative problem-solving.

                    When I'm not coding, I'm usually looking for something to create, whether it's a photo, video, or a handmade item. I also love the rush of inline skating and the excitement of building LEGO creations and I find joy in the challenge of learning new languages, which has taught me patience and persistence. These different interests keep me balanced and often spark unexpected solutions to coding problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm constantly inspired by nature, human emotions, and the creativity of others around me. The curiosity about the world drives both my creativity and my approach to web development. I want to create digital experiences that feel as genuine and engaging as the real-world moments I capture. Every hobby teaches me something about problem-solving, patience, or seeing things from different angles.
